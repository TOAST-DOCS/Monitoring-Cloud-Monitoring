## Monitoring > Cloud Monitoring > Metric Dictionary

## Metric Dictionary
- This is a list of defined metrics for monitoring services on NHN Cloud.
- Metric Dictionary helps you view and understand metrics for the services you monitor.
- You can find and use the metrics you need when configuring widgets. For more information, see the [console user guide](console-guide.md).
- In **Metric List**, you can see a list of metric dictionaries for each service.

### Filter
- You can apply filters to metrics.
- When you apply a filter, you'll only see metrics that match that filter.
  - For example, if you apply KR1 to the region filter, you will only see metrics that fall within the KR1 region among your metrics.
- Common filters are as follows.

| Filter name | Description           | Value                                                                  |
|-----|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Region  | NHN Cloud Region | kr1: Korea (Pangyo), kr2: Korea (Pyeongchon), kr3: Korea (Gwangju), us1: United States (California), jp1: Japan (Tokyo) |

### Legend
- You can apply a legend for metrics.
- When you apply a legend, the metric is applied in legend format.
  - For example, if you apply {{nhncloud_region}} to the legend, each metric appears as the region, such as kr1, kr2.
- Common legends are as follows.

| Filter name             | Description           | Value                                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nhncloud_region | NHN Cloud Region | kr1: Korea (Pangyo), kr2: Korea (Pyeongchon), kr3: Korea (Gwangju), us1: United States (California), jp1: Japan (Tokyo) |

## Instance
